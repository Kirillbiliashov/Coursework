# Coursework
This is implementation of the most popular hand game - poker. I am intending to create poker (Texas Holdem specifically) in a console, which will prompt you to choose  nickname, enter balance and play with 5 bots, who have random balance and make random decisions based on the strength of their hand. You may place bets and play as long as your balance is positive.   
# Future plans
* Enhance the project with WebSocket API, so it supports multiple players at one table at the same time
* Save history of game session to file storage
* If you want to play with bots, you will be able to choose difficulty level
