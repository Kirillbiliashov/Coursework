# Coursework
I have attempted to recreate poker card game (Texas Holdem) by writing backend logic that allows you to play with 5 more players (program-generated bots) with random initial balance. Similar to real life poker, every player receives 2 cards (from shuffled deck), and then betting round begins. When all betting rounds are over, chips are allocated to the winners. Players make desicions on how to act depending on the strengh of their hand. The game continues as long as your balance is positive or you don't want to quit. 
# Future plans (2nd course)
* Enhance the project with WebSocket API and Threads API, so that you may play with multiple real players at one table at the same time
* Save history of game session data (hands played, wins, losses etc) to a file 
* Integration of difficulty level if you play with bots
